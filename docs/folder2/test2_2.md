This page has a large and deeply nested TOC specified as a page variable.

It demonstrates:

* Deep nesting
* Urls can be outside of TOCS
* Using a name defined in the TOC rather than fetching from the document
* That the toc does not care about the real location of the files - you can have them anywhere.
