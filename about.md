I'm Tapple Gao, and I strive to make some of the best and most useful scrips and toolkits for avatar creators and modders. If you have ideas or requests about any of my products or avatars, feel free to contact me. If you would like assistance or announcements about my products, consider joining the Tavatar Support Group in my profile.

I provide these products and services in my spare time and do not charge for them. However, if you would like to say thank you, a donation of Linden Dollars is always appreciated.
