Not sure where to find the documentation of a certain prim you found on a HUD? This page summarizes every prim widget by name, and provides links to further documentation

### Widgets Not in Kit

These widgets exist in some of my other products made with these scripts, such as the [Teegle Horse](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Teegle-Horse-Bento-Avatar/10535881). They probably do not work without extra scripts not included in this kit, but I&#8217;m documenting them here for my benefit. I left them out because:

  1. It takes a lot of work to create proper demos and documentation for them
  2. I think they are less generally useful

If you would like to use them eventually, leave a comment, and I&#8217;ll consider properly including them in a future version of this kit. If you would like to use them now, [IM me in Secondlife](http://tavatar.org/about/) and I&#8217;ll help you out. I may charge you for my time.

:   &#8220;Alphamode Picker&#8221; is easier to use. Used in Teegle Horse Hud. Requires a special 5-faced mesh prim, not included

slider int texture specular

### Teegle Horse Texture Widgets

These texture changing widgets exist in the [Teegle Horse HUD](https://marketplace.secondlife.com/p/Teegle-Horse-Bento-Avatar/10535881), but are mostly obsoleted by the texture widgets in this kit. I am listing them here for my benefit.
